## Getting started to developing
Translink API key is required:
1. clone the reposiory to your work folder
2. you will need to register for a translink API key at https://www.translink.ca/about-us/doing-business-with-translink/app-developer-resources/register, sign in and it should email you your key.
3. create `keys.properties` in the `app` level directory and put `TRANSLINK_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"` (replace YOUR_API_KEY with your key you registered)
    1. To create this file easily in Android Studio, right-click the app directory,
    2. New -> Resource Bundle
    3. Enter in `keys` for Resource bundle base name field
    4. click ok
    5. `keys.properties` should be created and then paste the key in as intructed from step 3.
4. you are ready to use the Translink api and develop! ðŸ˜€

Now we need the AWS URL (or key) to communicate with our backend. For this, contact one of our team members for the key, place it in `keys.properties` like in the previous steps `AWS_API_KEY="URL"`.
